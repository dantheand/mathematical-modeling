    "# 20200702 dCas9 protease ODE modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of notebook\n",
    "* see if assumptions in analytical enzyme equation solutions are valid\n",
    "    * specifically: michaelis-menten and inhibitor equations\n",
    "* establish relationship between $K_I$, expression of peptide, and survival in a selection\n",
    "* try to map model results to more familiar Michaelis-Menten kinetics equations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quasi steady-state assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "$ k_f [E] [S] = k_r [ES] + k_{cat} [ES] = (k_r + k_{cat})[ES] $\n",
    "* assumes concentration of intermediate complex does not change on the time-scale fo product formation\n",
    "* this is where $K_M$ is derived from\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thoughts on initial velocity vs steady-state\n",
    "* is there a requirement when using velocity derivations for there to be a big discrepancy between $[E]$ and $[S]$??\n",
    "    * or does this requirement just stem from in vitro enzyme work where substrate is depleted\n",
    "* e.g. being in an exponentially-dividing cell will cause everything to reach a steady-state\n",
    "* steady-state values will probably be modified by cell division rates as another $k_{off}$ term"

    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "* Note that $u$ is the free uncaged Cas9. We can assume this is equal to the total uncaged Cas9 (and therefore promoter binding doesn't affect the steady-state value of uncaged Cas9) when $K << u$. Which is the case when protease is fully repressed and there's tons of free uncaged Cas9 (up to 500 molecules according to Shuyi's numbers)"
