    "* Origins of ratiometric comparison of repression / derepression gRNAs can be found analytically\n",
    "* Ratiometric performance depends on $g_d$, $K_d$, and $K_r$ values\n",
    "* When $K_d = K_r$ the ratiometric circuit is limited to only work below a ratio of 1\n",
    "* If $K_d >> K_r$, ratiometric performance goes above 1, but dynamic range is reduced\n",
    "* transcription from the free promoter term spoils the ratiometric response (because it is dependent on $g_r$\n",
    "* maximum $\\rho$ ($\\rho^+$) and minimum $g_d$ ($g_d^-$) have relationships to parameters\n",
    "    * possibly can define $\\rho^+$ with only $K_d$ and $K_r$\n",
    "    * need to check this with Domitilla to make sure this is a real constraint\n",
